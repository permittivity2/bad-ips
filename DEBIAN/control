Description: Distributed IP blocking system with hunter-gatherer architecture (Phase 10)
 Bad IPs is a distributed system for blocking malicious IP addresses across
 a homelab infrastructure. Phase 10 introduces threaded architecture with
 centralized PostgreSQL database for correlation and reporting.
 .
 Features:
  - Hunter mode: monitors local logs and blocks locally (<1ms blocking)
  - Multi-threaded async architecture with queue-based pipeline
  - Centralized PostgreSQL database for cross-server correlation
  - Local SQLite cache for fast blocking even when central DB is down
  - Gatherer mode: aggregates blocks from all servers and propagates
  - Real-time log monitoring with systemd journal integration
  - Configurable per-service attack pattern detection
  - Never-block CIDR filtering for trusted networks
  - Automatic expiration and cleanup of stale blocks
  - Adaptive pull interval for efficient central DB queries
  - Graceful degradation and failover to disk on queue overflow
