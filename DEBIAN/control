Description: Distributed IP blocking system with hunter-gatherer architecture
 Bad IPs is a distributed system for blocking malicious IP addresses across
 a homelab infrastructure. It uses nftables for blocking, SQLite for tracking,
 and SSH-based propagation for correlation across multiple servers.
 .
 Features:
  - Hunter mode: monitors local logs and blocks locally
  - Gatherer mode: aggregates blocks from all servers and propagates
  - Real-time log monitoring with systemd journal integration
  - Configurable per-service attack pattern detection
  - Never-block CIDR filtering for trusted networks
  - Automatic expiration and cleanup of stale blocks
